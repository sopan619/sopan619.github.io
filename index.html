          Constant worrying and overthinking can often lead to issues with
          mental health and well-being. Techniques such as deep breathing,

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Destructive thought patterns</h3>
        <p class="topic">
          You finally have a few quiet moments to yourself, only to immediately
          start wondering if you forgot to send that thank-you email or whether
          you’ve overestimated your chances of getting the promotion. Sound
          familiar? Worrying and overthinking are part of the human experience,
          but when left unchecked, they can take a toll on your well-being.
          Dwelling on the same thoughts may even increase your risk of certain
          mental health conditions, according to 2021 researchTrusted Source.
          So, what’s an overthinking person to do? These tips can help you move
          in the right direction.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">
          1. Step back and look at how you’re responding
        </h3>
        <p class="topic">
          The way you respond to your thoughts can sometimes keep you in a cycle
          of rumination, or repetitive thinking. Rumination can often cause
          negative consequencesTrusted Source to a person’s mental health. The
          next time you find yourself continuously running things over in your
          mind, take note of how it affects your mood. Do you feel irritated,
          nervous, or guilty? What’s the primary emotion behind your thoughts?
          Having self-awareness is key to changing your mindset.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">2. Find a distraction</h3>
        <p class="topic">
          Shut down overthinking by involving yourself in an activity you enjoy.
          This looks different for everyone, but ideas include:
          <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-item">learning some new kitchen skills by tackling a new recipe</li>
            <li class="list-item">going to your favorite workout class</li>
            <li class="list-item">taking up a new hobby, such as painting</li>
            <li class="list-item">volunteering with a local organization</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="box-comment">
            It can be hard to start something new when you’re overwhelmed by your thoughts. If finding a distraction feels daunting, try setting aside a small chunk of time — say, 30 minutes — every other day. Use this time to either explore potential distractions or dabble in existing ones.
          </div>
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">3. Take a deep breath</h3>
        <p class="topic">
          You’ve heard it a million times, but that’s because it works. The next time you find yourself tossing and turning over your thoughts, close your eyes and breathe deeply.
        </p> 
        <div class="box-comment-2">
          <h3 class="small-heading">Try It</h3>
          <p>Here’s a good starter exercise to help you unwind with your breath:</p>
          <ol >
            <li class="list-item">Find a comfortable place to sit and relax your neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Place one hand over your heart and the other across your belly.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Inhale and exhale through your nose, paying attention to how your chest and stomach move as you breathe.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Try doing this exercise 3 times a day for 5 minutes, or whenever you have racing thoughts.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">
          4. Meditate  </h3>
        <p class="topic">
          Developing a regular meditation practice is an evidence-backed way to help clear your mind of nervous chatter by turning your attention inward.
         <br> <br> All you need is 5 minutes and a quiet spot.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">
          5. Look at the bigger picture
          </h3>
        <p class="topic">
          How will all the issues floating around in your mind affect you 5 or 10 years from now? Will anyone really care that you bought a fruit plate for the potluck instead of baking a pie from scratch?
